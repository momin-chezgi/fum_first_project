For translation, we prefered to use below words:
Draftsman for the player.
monster for the creatures that used to live under the ground in the maze.
light-sourec for the final goal.

'1.cpp' is for the first phase.
'2.cpp' is for the second.
And so on.

Tips:
1. Regarding to the access of Mr.Abrishamy, we're using C++ files and compilers instead of C.
2. We use two differnt IDEs: VSCode and CLion.
3. Because of the different IDE, we added two folders for two IDEs proccesses such as compiler.(but actually they did, we didn't!)


First Phase, Printing the status:
I used terminal for printing the status of the grid. (and it will soon be expanded for presenting the game)
this is a bit different from the document presentation, Because it prints corners, walls and cells.
Any sign has a meaning:
'#' shows that it's either a corner or a wall.
'.' shows an empty cell.
'S' shows the light-source.
'M' shows a monster.
'D' shows a draftman.
